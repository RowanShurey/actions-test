[REDACTED] provided her testimony regarding the events that occurred at [REDACTED]. The court session lasted for three hours. During her testimony, [REDACTED] recounted specific details about the incident that took place on [REDACTED] at approximately [REDACTED] in the evening. The presiding judge, [REDACTED], allowed the witness to reference photographic evidence marked as Exhibit [REDACTED] while explaining her recollection of events.

When cross-examined by defense attorney [REDACTED], the witness maintained her account despite attempts to highlight inconsistencies between her current testimony and previous statements given to Detective [REDACTED] on [REDACTED]. The prosecution, led by [REDACTED], objected to several lines of questioning regarding the witness's relationship with [REDACTED], which the court sustained.

Medical records presented as Evidence [REDACTED] confirmed injuries consistent with the witness's account. Expert testimony from Dr. [REDACTED] of [REDACTED] Hospital supported these findings, specifically noting that [REDACTED] exhibited signs of [REDACTED] that aligned with the timeline presented by the prosecution.

The defense called into question the reliability of the witness's identification of [REDACTED], citing poor lighting conditions at [REDACTED] and the witness's admission that she had consumed [REDACTED] earlier that evening. However, CCTV footage from [REDACTED] appeared to corroborate key elements of the witness's testimony regarding the movements of [REDACTED] before and after the alleged incident.

Following the testimony, the court adjourned until [REDACTED] when [REDACTED] is scheduled to take the stand. Judge [REDACTED] instructed the jury to disregard any media coverage of the case and reminded them of their obligation to consider only evidence presented within the courtroom.
